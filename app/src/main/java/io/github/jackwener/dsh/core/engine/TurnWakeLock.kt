/**
 * Keeps the CPU awake while a turn is actively running (review §6/G3). A foreground service does
 * not prevent CPU suspend, so with the screen off a model stream or tool call could stall.
 *
 * Held from `:main` (a wake lock is per-app/uid, so it covers the `:engine` process too) while any
 * session is Running — not while it waits for an approval, an answer or an unlock. Each acquire
 * carries a [TIMEOUT_MS] timeout and is renewed on session activity (at most every [RENEW_MS]), so a
 * wedged turn that produces no events lets the lock lapse on its own; it is released as soon as no
 * session is running (finish, error, stop, engine loss).
