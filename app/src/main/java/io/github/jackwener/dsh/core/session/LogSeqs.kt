/**
 * Maps dsh `session.event` seqs to the seqs they are logged under, per session and engine
 * generation.
 *
 * dsh notifies an event before it is durable, so when `:engine` dies the tail it already sent may
 * never reach its journal. The next generation resumes from the journal and hands out those seqs
 * again for new events — host repro (js/test/host-ac8-resume.mjs): killed after notifying seq 11
 * with the journal ending at 7, the restarted engine sent the continuation's `turn/start` as seq 9.
 * Used as identities, those seqs made the app drop the continuation turn as duplicates of the dead
 * generation's events. So each generation's first event for a session fixes an offset that places
 * it after everything already logged; within a generation seqs map 1:1 (offset 0 in the normal
 * case, where a new generation continues past the log).
